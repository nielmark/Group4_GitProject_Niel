Welcome!

This is a Scheduler App that aides in managing and creating schedules. The app is set to be continuously running, it defaults in prompting for a name input to be assigned a schedule. 

Input any name or a set of string of names to be prompted for a schedule assignment. 

Here's a list of special commands that can be used as an input for extended functionality:

PRINT - prints the entirety of the schedule created. Once called, the program exits.

RESET - resets the schedule record to a blank slate.

EXIT - exits in the program with the data saved.
